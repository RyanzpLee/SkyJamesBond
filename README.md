# The name is Bond ... James Bond

Sky assessment centre task created with React. I paired up with Zyron Dias, and we worked together to create a TV programme guide app.

The task was themed around James Bond, and we were tasked to create a React web app that showed a tv programme guide, and each channel was named after a Bond actor, with the table cells showing the related movie they starred in.



## MVP

The website must show a programme guide that displays the proper channels, and associated movies. The movies must start at the right start times and end times. No programmes will be displayed if there are none to be shown

The webapp must also be able to upload and read a data file (JSON) and then the app will parse the information for it to be displayed in the guide table.


## Requirements
- [ ] Read the data file, and store the data
- [ ] Build the dynamic table framework that will automatically add more rows and columns as necessary
- [ ] Syling of table
- [ ] Movie cells must be displayed in the correct channel
- [ ] Movie cells must begin at the correct start time
- [ ] Movie cells must end at the correct finish time

### Low priority
- [ ] Clicking on a Movie cell will bring up a pop up


## Todo 

- [x] Created data file layout
- [x] Started the Main table component
- [x] Created the movie cell component
- [ ] Create form component
- [ ] Finish the movie cell method
